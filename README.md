# supersonic-trans
## Why did this?
I am a common chinese software engineer in Shanghai. I heard that a guy who did the same job can buy a apartment in shanghai. The thing should not be like this.This tech should be open for everyone. So I did a small job to study this.
And I will do the job timely but not guaranteeã€‚

## How to run
This is a demo for android devices transaction thru supersonic.
You can import the project to Eclipse and run it.

## Remain issue
I only did the demo level job. It could lose some data during transaction. And the transfaction speed is not good.


So I am thinking about the encoder and decoder solution, which can speed up the transaction and improve the transferring qualitiy.
Hope some one give the some idea or solutions. You can reach me via:
